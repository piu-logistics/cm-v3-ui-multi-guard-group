Bactra was no ordinary camel; he bore two mighty humps upon his back, a symbol of his great energy reserves, firmness and symmetry. Bactra roamed the vastness as the herd leader, with metaphysical guidance from a wise Humpkeeper. As a seasoned collector of AlkebulanMeta Bactrian Camels, the Humpkeeper knew the true origin story of how the Bactrians arrived in the metaverse. As he gathered his collection the One would reason with the head Camels like Bactra, these special sci-future creatures knew the deepest secrets of the cosmos, and they would channel their gems of insightâ€¦ from time to time.
